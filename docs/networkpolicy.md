# Cloud Controller NetworkPolicy

Cloud Controller project does not consume the Antrea NetworkPolicy(ANP) resource
directly. The ANP object is used by [Antrea](https://antrea.io/) project, where
`antrea-controller` Pod watches for the Antrea NetworkPolicy(ANP) objects and
converts each ANP object to an Antrea internal [NetworkPolicy](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/blob/main/pkg/apis/controlplane/v1beta2/types.go#L202)
object for further processing. This Antrea internal `NetworkPolicy` object
will be used by Cloud Controller to enforce the network policies on public cloud 
virtual machines.

The `cloud controller` pod registers with the antrea `API server`, to receive
all the events related to `AddressGroups`, `AppliedToGroups` and
`NetworkPolicies` objects. The `cloud controller` translates these
NetworkPolicy related objects to the corresponding cloud constructs. Each antrea
internal `NetworkPolicy` object will result in a combination of one
or more cloud network security groups(NSG). The `AddressGroups` field will be
translated to a cloud NSG, and it will be embedded in `source/destination` field
of a cloud network security rule. The `AppliedToGroups` will translated to a
NSG, and it will be attached to the public cloud VMs. Currently, enforcing ANP
is only supported on AWS and Azure clouds.

## Introduction

This section gives a brief introduction about cloud network security groups and
Antrea Network Policy object. These two concepts are the basics to
understand how Cloud Controller realizes network polices on public cloud VMs. If
you are already familiar with these two concepts, please skip this section and
proceed to the [Implementation](#implementation) section.

### Antrea Network Policy

Each Antrea internal `NetworkPolicy` object contains a `Name` and `Namespace`
field that uniquely identifies an Antrea internal `NetworkPolicy` object. 
Name and Namespace corresponds to user facing Antrea Network Policy(ANP). It
contains list of rules and a list of references to the appliedToGroups. 
Each rule contains,
- A direction field.
- A list of services(port).
- To/From field - IPBlock and reference to a list `AddressGroups`.

An `AddressGroup` is used in `To/From` field of an ANP Rule. Each 
`AddressGroup` contains the following:
- An auto-generated name, which uniquely identifies an `AdressGroup`.
- A list of GroupMembers, each may contain references of ExternalEntities if
  applicable.
- A list of Endpoint, each contains IP address and ports.

An `AppliedToGroup` is used in `AppliedTo` field of an ANP. Each `AppliedToGroup`
contains the following:
- An auto-generated name(namespace-less) uniquely identifies a `AppliedToGroup`.
- A list of GroupMembers, each may contain references of ExternalEntities if
  applicable.
- A list of Endpoints, each contains IP address and ports.

### Network Security Group

A Network Security Group(NSG) is a whitelist, which is at a VPC level. It is
uniquely identified by its name or an ID. It contains zero or more Network
Interface Cards(NIC). A NIC may be associated with zero or more NSGs. A NSG
contains Ingress and Egress rules.

**An Ingress Rule includes**:
- IPBlocks - a list of source IP blocks of the permitted incoming traffic.
- Ports - a list of source ports of the permitted incoming traffic.
- SecurityGroups - a list of securityGroups from which incoming traffic is
  permitted.

**An Egress Rule includes**:
- IPBlocks - a list of destination IP blocks of the permitted outgoing traffic.
- Ports - a list of destination ports of the permitted outgoing traffic.
- SecurityGroups - a list of securityGroups to which outgoing traffic is
  permitted.

## Implementation 

Cloud Controller creates two types of network security groups(NSGs) to enforce
network polices on public cloud VMs, which are called as `AddressGroup NSG` and
`AppliedTo NSG`. An Antrea internal `NetworkPolicy` is realized on the cloud VMs
via a combination of `AddressGroup NSG` and `AppliedTo NSG`. For better
performance/scalability, all cloud calls to manage antrea created NSGs are
designed to be asynchronous.

### AddressGroup NSG 

This NSG internally is referred to as cloud membership only security group, as
it contains only the GroupMembers. This type of NSG is created with a prefix
`cloudcontroller-ag-adressgroupname`, where the prefix `ag-` implies it is just
an `AddressGroup` based NSG. 

- Each Antrea AddressGroup is mapped to zero or more cloud membership only
`AddressGroup NSG`, and zero or more IP blocks. 
- Each `AddressGroup NSG`, correspond to a VPC, and a list of cloud resources,
  which will not have ingress/egress rules.

### AppliedTo NSG

This NSG will be applied to the public cloud VMs. This type of NSG is created
with a prefix `cloudcontroller-at-appliedtogroupname`, where the prefix `at-`
implies it is an `AppliedTo` based NSG.

- Each Antrea AppliedGroup is mapped to zero or more cloud `AppliedTo NSG`
- Each `AppliedTo NSG` correspond to a VPC and a list of cloud resources, which
  will have ingress/egress rules associated with it.

### Mapping Antrea Network Policy To NSG

Each `AddressGroup NSG` and IPBlocks uniquely maps `To/From` fields in the user
configured Antrea Network Policy. Each `AppliedTo NSG` uniquely maps to an 
`AppliedTo` field in the Antrea Network Policy. Each `AppliedTo NSG` creates
ingress and egress rules based on cloud membership only `AddressGroup NSG` and
IPBlocks associated with an Antrea Network Policy.

### ANP Rule realization

It is desirable to show what Antrea Network Policies are associated with a
specific cloud resource and the Antrea Network Policies realization status. 
Each cloud resource shall keep track of cloud `AppliedTo NSG` it is
associated with. The union of Antrea Network Policies associated with these cloud
`AppliedTo NSG`, is entirety of the NetworkPolicies intended to this
network resource. An Antrea NetworkPolicy is considered to be successfully
applied to a network resource, when the following expectations are met.
- Its `AppliedTo NSG` to which the network resource is a member of,
  are created/updated with no error.
- Its `AddressGroup NSG` are created/updated with no error.

## Illustration with an Example

In this example, AWS cloud is configured using Cloud Provider Account(CPA) and
the cloud resource filter is configured using Cloud Entity Selector(CES) to
import 3 VMs that belong to vpc `vpc-0cfddb48a8119837e`.

### List Virtual Machines

The following kubectl command can be used to retrieve VirtualMachine resources
that are imported:

```bash
kubectl get virtualmachines -A
kubectl get vm -A
```

```text
# Output
NAMESPACE   NAME                  CLOUD-PROVIDER   VIRTUAL-PRIVATE-CLOUD   STATUS
sample-ns   i-049076f0e26bb1515   AWS              vpc-0cfddb48a8119837e   running
sample-ns   i-092142399d95fa775   AWS              vpc-0cfddb48a8119837e   running
sample-ns   i-0a95353bdf01bb9a0   AWS              vpc-0cfddb48a8119837e   running
```

### List External Entities

The following kubectl command can be used to retrieve ExternalEntity resources
corresponding to each VM:

```bash
kubectl get externalentities -A
kubectl get ee -A

```

```text
# Output
NAMESPACE   NAME                                 AGE
sample-ns   virtualmachine-i-049076f0e26bb1515   68m
sample-ns   virtualmachine-i-092142399d95fa775   68m
sample-ns   virtualmachine-i-0a95353bdf01bb9a0   68m
```

### Create a sample Antrea Network Policy

A sample AntreaNetworkPolicy is shown below, which specifies an Ingress rule
allowing TCP traffic on port 22. The `from` field is an `externalEntitySelector`
with matching labels as `name.crd.cloud.antrea.io: i-0a95353bdf01bb9a0`.
And the `appliedTo` field is an `externalEntitySelector` with a matching
label as `kind.crd.cloud.antrea.io: virtualmachine`. 

```bash
# Add Policy to Allow SSH
apiVersion: crd.antrea.io/v1alpha1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: vm-anp
  namespace: sample-ns
spec:
  priority: 1
  appliedTo:
  - externalEntitySelector:
      matchLabels:
        kind.crd.cloud.antrea.io: virtualmachine
    ingress:
    - action: Allow
      from:
      - externalEntitySelector:
          matchLabels:
            name.crd.cloud.antrea.io: i-0a95353bdf01bb9a0
      ports:
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 22
```

### Mapping Antrea Network Policy To NSG

The `cloud controller` converts the example ANP into a combination of
`AddressGroup NSG` and `AppliedTo NSG` and attaches the NSGs to the respective
VMs, as shown in the below image.

### AddressGroup NSG

The AddressGroup `0e106911-348f-57d1-9bf6-1615fb830aaf` corresponds to the 
`from` field of ANP. This group contains only one ExternalEntity as the Group
Members. The `cloud controller` will convert this AddressGroup into an 
`AddressGroup NSG` with NSG name as
`cloudcontroller-ag-0e106911-348f-57d1-9bf6-1615fb830aaf`.

```bash
kubectl describe addressgroups 0e106911-348f-57d1-9bf6-1615fb830aaf
```

```text

```

### AppliedToGroup NSG

The AppliedToGroup `8f0aae3c-5315-54d4-8a4d-6184398f6584` corresponds to the
`appliedTo` field of the ANP. This group contains all the 3 ExternalEntity as
the Group Members. The `cloud controller` will convert this AppliedToGroup into
an `AppliedTo NSG` with NSG name as
`cloudcontroller-at-8f0aae3c-5315-54d4-8a4d-6184398f6584` and it will attach this
NSG to all the 3 VMs.

```bash
kubectl describe appliedtogroups 8f0aae3c-5315-54d4-8a4d-6184398f6584
```

### Verify ANP Rule realization on VM

The following kubectl command can be used to retrieve VirtualMachinePolicy
resources, which shows the ANP rules realization on each VM.

```bash
kubectl get vmp -A
kubectl get virtualmachinepolicy -A
```

```text
# Output
NAMESPACE   VM NAME               REALIZATION   COUNT
